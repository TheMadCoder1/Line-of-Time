# Line of Time
A simple Timeline app in which you input events and their info (dates, what happened, etc.), and it will automatically organize it onto a timeline for you to view.

I decided to make this when I took a history final and I struggled to remember the sequence in which events occurred, and I thought that it would be nice if I could easily make a timeline that I could easily add new events to, and it would automatically organize it all, so that is what I am doing.

My current most fluent programming language is Python, so this is all in Python, and I intend to use the Kivy library for the graphical environment, as it is cross platform and more modern than Tkinter.

I am just starting development - there currently is nothing.
